I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Walgreens-Boots-Alliance. Most of my current work falls under data engineering: building ETL pipelines,designing and integrating data systems including DBs and APIs to support business requirements.

Previously I worked at the University of Colorado where I did app development and data engineering work for large EHR systems.

My personal interests are in functional programming. See my projects in OCaml, Common Lisp, and Clojure - languages I love working in.

Ideas to cover:
- Riemann's on the hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry
- synthetic geometry and the 4CT
- new old books - digital libray and pollen
- key chord
- photography
- translation projects
