Greetings! I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Walgreens-Boots-Alliance. Most of my current work falls under data engineering: building ETL pipelines, designing and integrating data systems including DBs and APIs to support business requirements. Previously I worked at the University of Colorado where I did app development and data engineering work for large EHR systems. While a grad student at CU, I did research applying deep learning to problems in graph theory and computer networks. My professional start in software occured while working in a molecular biology lab at CU.
