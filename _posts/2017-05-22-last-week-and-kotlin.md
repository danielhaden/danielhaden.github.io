## Kotlin at Google I/O

Last week was a very exciting week for Kotlin. To begin with, [Google announced](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html) first-class support for Kotlin on Android, at their annual developer conference, Google I/O. 

<br/>
I was fortunate enough to take part in the event 
and gave a short talk on Kotlin alongside [Andrey](https://twitter.com/abreslav). If you've still haven't played with Kotlin and would like to know some of the benefits it offers, this talk might help convince you. If it doesn't, well [9:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1RVYt2QKQE&t=564s)*. I'll keep trying!

## Kotlin at Spring I/O 
 
Secondly, Pivotal announced the release of Spring Framework version 5, with [full support for Kotlin](https://twitter.com/snicoll/status/865118526700498944) at their [Spring I/O conference in Barcelona](http://2017.springio.net/#venue). There's no video available yet, but you can see some of the features
in the [early preview blog post](https://spring.io/blog/2017/01/04/introducing-kotlin-support-in-spring-framework-5-0).


<br/>
It's been a really exciting few weeks and we're very grateful to everyone that believed in Kotlin. It is your passion and devotion that have made these things happen. 

<br/>
Thank you for your continued support!

<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: And don't forget we have our own [KotlinConf](https://kotlinconf.com) coming up in November.
