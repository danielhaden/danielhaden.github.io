At times of pressure, is when we need to show patience.<br/>

At times of stress, is when we need to show empathy.<br/>

At times when we feel things are falling apart, is when we need to show the most strength.<br/>


<br/>
Forgetting this, we end up in a bad place. But sometimes we're fortunate to have those around us, bring us back to our space.
