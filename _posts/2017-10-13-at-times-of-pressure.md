At times of pressure is when we need to show patience.
At times of stress is when we need to show empathy.
At times when we feel things are falling apart is when we need to show the most strength.

<br/>
Forgetting this, we end up in a bad place. 

<br/>
Often we're fortunate to have those around us to bring us back to our space.
